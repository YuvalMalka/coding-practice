## 0.1.0 - 2019-05-10

### Initial

* **Yesterday**: on-site technical interview and officially graduated 
  * When you have too much coffee and forget to eat because you are too nervous and your first hour of tech interviews is about designing a database \(in SQL\) and you can’t remember shit from it and you simply try to wing it… Second hour of tech interview is about algorithm and you slowly warm up to talk through your thought process and nail it. Third hour of you tech interview they are asking you to live code an interactive blackjack game and you just hope for an earthquake so you can just run for your live - ended up doing mostly whiteboard and a little bit of pseudo code. 
  * Lunch, what can I say, you get some food but because you try to answer all the questions in between bits, you end up eating - very little. You leave lunch with a half empty plate at best. • Got to talk with the COO about team work, team interaction, how do you deal with nay sayers, how do you tell others about their short comings and there was more. 
  * By the end of the day I ended up in a bar for a happy hour drink - ordered myself an old-fashion :tumbler\_glass: 
* • **Today**: wrote follow-up interview letter, more coffee, networking, coding for fun - a little bit or should I try to do the blackjack game? 
* • **Blockers**: exhausted
