# “Why did you decide to learn data science?”

![](.gitbook/assets/image.png)

I don’t remember when I came across “The Visual Display of Quantitative Information” by Edward R.Tufte, but I remember that I was fascinated by it and read it in one swoop. And that I just wanted to do cool visualizations. But at that time there was no need for it.

Sometime in the early nineties \(I believe\), I saw a short film by a Japanese computer graphics company visualizing all data available at that time about Tokyo. And again was just fascinated by it and just wanted to do that. But still, at that time there was no real need for it. At least not in Germany.

Fast forward, another Edward Tufte book and much more cool things over the time, I found myself at a crossroad. Do I take the blue pill or the red pill? And because I can’t remember which pill does what, I decided to take some time off to figure out what I would love to do next.

So here I am, rediscovering my fascination for data and visualization. Looking forward to using my experience in computer graphics and combine it with the newly learned knowledge.
